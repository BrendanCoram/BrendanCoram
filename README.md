# 👋  Who am I?

Hi, I’m @BrendanCoram

I am addicted to 💡 ideas, startups, AI and dreaming about the future. I have been working with corporate and startups for the last 25 years, helping them figure out who their customers are, what they want and how to beat the competition. 

  
# ❓ Why am I on GitHub?

Imagine being able to take an idea from post it to market test in 24 hours. What about 10 minutes? 

Chat GPT just put the worlds information at our fingertips. What used to take weeks of user testing, market research and iteration can now be done in a few hours. All we have to do is know what questions to ask, and how to ask them. The rest is up to us. I am here to create a cummunity of designers, innovators, and dreamers. People who want to take their ideas and make them work. Faster.
